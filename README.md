## üìå Project Objective

The goal of this project was to design an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard in Power BI to analyze employee attrition and provide actionable insights. It helps HR teams identify key factors driving attrition, employee demographics, salary impact, and job role contributions, enabling better workforce planning and retention strategies.

## üìÇ Dataset Used

-HR Analytics Dataset with details such as:

-Employee demographics (Age, Gender, Education, Job Role, Department)

-Salary information

-Job Involvement and Role Tenure

-Attrition status (Yes/No)

-Dataset was cleaned, standardized, and transformed for accurate reporting.

## ‚ùì Key Business Questions (KPIs)

-What is the overall attrition rate?

-What are the average age, salary, and years at company of employees?

-What is the attrition count and trend across different education levels, job roles, and departments?

.How does attrition vary by age group and gender?

.Which salary slab contributes most to attrition?

.At which career stages (years at company / current role) does attrition occur the most?

How does job involvement impact attrition?

Which job roles are most affected by attrition?

‚öôÔ∏è Process

Data Cleaning & Preparation

Removed missing values and standardized data types.

Created calculated columns and measures in DAX (Attrition Count, Attrition Rate, Avg Salary, Avg Tenure, etc.).

Data Modeling & Measures

Built relationships between fields and designed calculated KPIs.

Developed measures for Attrition %, Avg Salary, Avg Age, and Role-specific attrition.

Dashboard Development

Used visualizations: Donut Charts, Bar/Column Charts, Line Graphs, Treemaps, and Tables.

Added slicers for department-wise and role-wise filtering.

Designed clean layout for quick insights.

üìä Dashboard Insights

Company workforce: 1,470 employees, with an Attrition Count of 237 (16.1%).

Males (140) attrite more than females (79).

Life Sciences (38%) and Medical (27%) are the top education groups affected.

Age group 26‚Äì35 years shows the maximum attrition (116 employees).

Low salary employees (‚â§5K) form the highest attrition group (163 employees).

Highest attrition job roles:

Laboratory Technician ‚Äì 62

Sales Executive ‚Äì 57

Research Scientist ‚Äì 47

Sales Representative ‚Äì 33

Most attrition happens in the first 2 years of employment.

Job involvement score = 2 (71 employees) and score = 3 (125 employees) have the highest attrition rates.

Employees in their current role for less than 3 years are most likely to leave.

‚úÖ Final Conclusion

Attrition is concentrated among younger employees (26‚Äì35 years), low salary bands (‚â§5K), and specific job roles (Sales, Laboratory, Research).

To reduce attrition, HR should focus on:

Improving compensation packages for lower salary groups.

Career development and engagement programs for employees within their first 3 years.

Targeted retention strategies for high-attrition roles.

Boosting job involvement through recognition, role clarity, and employee engagement activities.
